# Tic Tac Toe

> This is a Tic Tac Toe game build with Ruby by Me and my partner Zakariae El Mejdki.

Rules of the game:

1. The main idea of the game is to complete a line horizontally, vertically or cross over the table
2. There are two players one should start with O mark another with the X mark
3. The player that fills the entire line with their mark wins!
